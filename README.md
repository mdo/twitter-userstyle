# Twitter Userstyle

Bring the aesthetic of Twitter for iOS to the [newly updated Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/twitter/status/422840296175443968) with this custom userstyle.

### What changes

* Overrides nearly all of the new accent color treatment across the interface.
* Styles the topbar like that of iOS.
* Removes the rather heavy global focus style.
* Changes the stats design to look closer to iOS.
* Fixes the inconsistent border colors by using the same color across the board.
* Makes the topbar full-width instead of being slightly wider than the content.
* Outright hides the Who to Follow widget those avatars are quite large and the buttons' text is misaligned.
* Hides the text for each Tweet action (Reply, Favorite, etc) so only the icons are shown.

### Why

More than anything else, this is an hour-long experiment that I decided to open source. I enjoy using Twitter's native apps and believe the same design can work on all platforms.

Beyond that, I think (and hope) Twitter can grow to longer support user themes or customizations (beyond profile avatars and headers) without sacrificing the  overall experience or utility. So far, I'm enjoying it.

### Todo

Want to help? Great! Submit a pull request that does one of the following:

* Move timestamps away from the user name in Tweets and back to the right
* Fix accent colors everywhere
* Fix borders and shadows on dropdown menus
* Fix remaining uses of the accent color

### Bug reports

I've disabled issues on this repository. If you'd like to help, submit a pull request instead. I have little intent of supporting every edge case, though I do want to improve this.
